Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. 


My research focuses on development economics, spatial economics, and economic history. I study the factors that shape differences in economic activites across space and time from a historical perspective. 


Here is my CV.
