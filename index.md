Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago</a>, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market.

My research focuses on **development economics**, **spatial economics**, and **economic history**. I study the factors that shape differences in economic activites across space and time from a historical perspective.
