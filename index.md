Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago</a>, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. **I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market**.

My research focuses on **urban and spatial economics**, **development economics**, and **economic history**. I study the factors that drive differences in economic activity across space and time, with a particular focus on the mechanisms behind regional persistence and leapfrogging.
