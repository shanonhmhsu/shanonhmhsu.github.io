Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. **I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market**.

My research focuses on **urban and spatial economics**, **development economics**, and **economic history**. I study the mechanisms behind regional persistence and leapfrogging, with a particular focus on agglomeration and technological transitions. Using historical data, my work aims to uncover the social and economic forces shaping long-term spatial and economic dynamics.
