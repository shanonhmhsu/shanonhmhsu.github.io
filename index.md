Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I received my Ph.D. in 2024. **I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market**.

My research centers on **urban and spatial economics**, **development economics**, and **economic history**. I study the social and economic mechanisms that drive regional persistence and leapfrogging, with a particular focus on agglomeration and technological transitions.
