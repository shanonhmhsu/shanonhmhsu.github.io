      <p style="font-size: 16px;">Abstract: How do social divisions affect the benefits of agglomeration? While the clustering of people can enhance productivity through local, social interactions, divisions such as ethnic tension and segregation may limit these gains. To answer this question, this paper examines an ethnic-based resettlement program that forcibly relocated 600,000 rural Chinese into compact villages in 1950s British Malaya. I find that areas with higher resettlement had persistently higher population densities and concentrations of Chinese, driven by both the program's direct impact and internal migration. Decades later, these areas became wealthier, more industrialized, and exhibited greater labor market specialization. However, the economic benefits primarily accrued to the Chinese, while other groups saw only marginal gains when geographically integrated with the Chinese and working in non-agricultural sectors. To assess the overall impacts, I estimate a quantitative spatial model that allows local agglomeration externalities to vary by sector and ethnic composition. While the resettlement increased aggregate output, the gains were insufficient to offset the welfare losses from the program's coercive nature.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 16px;">Abstract: We examine the long transition from water to steam power in US manufacturing, focusing on early users of mechanical power:  lumber and flour mills. Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850-1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption.</p>
