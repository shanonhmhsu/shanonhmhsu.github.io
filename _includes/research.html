      <p style="font-size: 16px;">Abstract: This paper examines the agglomeration effects of the forced relocation of 600,000 rural Chinese into compact villages in 1950s British Malaya. Areas with higher resettlement had persistently higher population densities and concentrations of Chinese, driven by both the program's direct impact and subsequent internal migration. Decades later, these areas became more industrialized, exhibited greater labor market specialization, were more educated, and had higher incomes. However, the economic benefits of a denser Chinese labor market mainly accrued to the Chinese population, indicating cross-ethnic frictions in productivity spillovers. Estimating a quantitative spatial model that allows agglomeration externalities to vary by sector and local ethnic composition, I show that while the resettlement increases aggregate output by relocating people to areas with better market access and industrial productivity, the gains are not large enough to offset welfare losses from the program's coercive nature. Cross-ethnic frictions hinder non-Chinese industrialization, and I find that an ethnicity-based wage subsidy for non-Chinese in the industrial sector increases aggregate output while reducing inequality.</p> <!-- Set font size for abstract -->

      <p style="font-size: 16px;">Abstract: We examine the long transition from water to steam power in US manufacturing, focusing on early users of mechanical power:  lumber and flour mills. Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850-1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption.</p> <!-- Set font size for abstract -->
